This documentation shows how to build the first [BRICK Schema model](https://brickschema.org/).

Second, there are a few examples online to show the step by step process although some of them are developed a few years ago:
* [Koh et al. (2017)](https://github.com/BuildSysUniformMetadata/brick-tutorial-buildsys2017/blob/master/1.%20Brick%20Composition.ipynb)
